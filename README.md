# GenoMap-TCER-Replicate work

## TCER
TCER is a self-supervised deep learning framework for gene expression recovery. The proposed pipeline consists of two steps, inluding (i) we first reposition the genes in such a way that their spatial configuration reflects their interactive relationships; and (ii) we then use a self-supervised 2D convolutional neural network (ER-Net) to extract the contextual features of the interactions from the spatially configured genes and impute the omitted values.
